# Unit 19 React Homework: Employee Directory
## Description 

This is a homework requirement for GT Full Stack Flex Program. We are using react to create an employee user directory. When you click on the name, the list sorts alphabetically by the first name. When you search, you receive the search for the employee you searched. With more, the app will be destructured to be more re-usable. This is calling on the API random user.
