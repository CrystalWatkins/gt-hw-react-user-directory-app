This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
# React Quiz

In this activity, we will begin by installing a few helpful packages and then explore the React documentation to answer questions.

## Instructions

### Part 1

* Begin by executing Create React App by running the following command in your terminal:

`npx create-react-app <appname>` where `<appname>` is what you want to name your app. Example: `npx create-react-app practiceapp`.

### Part 2

* While those are installing, work with your group to answer each of the following questions using the [ReactJS Documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/):

1. In the previous section we executed Create React App. What is it for?
getting the react components- downloading and installing them

2. What are some benefits of using ReactJS?
loads faster, reusable components, develop new features in react without writing existing code, 

3. What is a React component? Hint: Check the "Components and Props" section of the React documentation.
lets you build capsulated components - broken down for reusable components

4. What is the significance of the `ReactDOM.render` method? Hint: Check the "ReactDOM" section of the documentation.
creates a node and allows react to listen to it 

5. What is JSX? Why does Facebook recommend using it? Hint: Check the "Introducing JSX" section of the documentation.
inject data into HTML- functions and regular javascript expressions

6. What does Facebook recommend as the “best way to start building a new React single page application”? Hint: Check the "Installation" section of the React documentation.
create react app - doesn't have to create webpack and has all the dependencies for you

7. What is Babel? And what role does it play in converting JSX into vanilla JavaScript? Hint: Check the "Introducing JSX" section of the documentation.
compiling JSX and allows you to update the DOM easier


8. What is the significance of { } curly braces in JSX? Hint: Check the "Introducing JSX" section of the documentation.
inject JS expressions into JSX expression

9. What is a component prop? Hint: Check the "Components and Props" section of the React documentation.
React components are small, reusable pieces of code that return a React element to be rendered to the page that are called props

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
